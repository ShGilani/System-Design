Classic MVC Architechture:
----------------------------------------

Traditional web applications have involved little client-side behavior, but instead have relied on the server for all navigation, queries, and updates the app might need to make. 

Each new operation made by the user would be translated into a new web request, with the result being a full page reload in the end user's browser.

Classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks typically follow this approach, with each new request corresponding to a different controller action, which in turn would work with a model and return a view. Some individual operations on a given page might be enhanced with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) functionality, but the overall architecture of the app used many different MVC views and URL endpoints.

SPA - Single Page Applications:
--------------------------------------------
These apps make heavy usage of web APIs for their data needs and can provide much richer user experiences.

*** Many web applications involve a combination of traditional web application behavior (typically for content) and SPAs (for interactivity)

Use a SPA when:
Your application must expose a rich user interface with many features.
Your application must already expose an API for other (internal or public) clients.

The fact that each unique page of the site has its own URL that can be bookmarked and indexed by search engines
