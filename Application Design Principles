Modularity / Separation of Concerns/Responsibilities / Layering / N-Tiers

Encapsulation: Internal State, Behaviour
Outsiders or Collaborators shouldnt be allowed direct access of state. Only through getters and setters (Interface / Public Contract).


MVC:
MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.
Model represents the data
View is the User Interface.
Controller is the request handler.

Loose Coupling:
In an object-oriented design, classes should be designed in a loosely coupled way.
Loosely coupled means changes in one class should not force other classes to change.
